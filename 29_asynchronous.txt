1. Any computation we do requires processor for our Javascript engine to get the job done
2. Many requests interact with things outside of the processor. for example they may communicate over a network or request data from the storage disk.
3. This is a lot slower than getting it from memory
4. We don't want our processor to sit idle when such things are happening

difference between Asynchronous and Synchronous 

An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time

whereas In Synchronous : 
1 Synchronous programming model things happen one at a time

2. when you call a function that performs  along action, it returns only when the action has finished so that it can return the result

3. this stops your program for the time the action takes.

THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO WRITE Asynchronous CODE:

1. Async/await
2.Callbacks
3.Promises
