Which loop should we use? and When?
Each type of loop is useful in a different scenario:

If indexes are needed while accessing an array of indexes related logical stuff are there, the for loop is a good choice.
If there is a need to access keys/properties regardless of the sequence, use a for-in loop.
If there is a need to iterate through items of an iterable, then the for-ofloop is the right choice.
